\begin_layout Abstract
Ni and Mn contents of olivines in primitive basalts are increasingly being
 used as a tool to infer the presence of lithological variations in their
 mantle source regions.
 In particular, high Ni and low Mn concentrations have been argued to indicate
 a large contribution to the melting from olivine-free recycled lithologies.
 Minor element concentrations are influenced both by source composition
 and processes including partial melting and fractional crystallisation.
 To understand whether these minor element signals are truely diagnostic
 of litholgical source heterogeneity it is necessary to disentangle these
 source and process controls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
A forward model of isobaric, non-modal fractional melting of peridotitic
 mantle during adiabatic decompression melting is developed.
 Changes in melt fraction, temperature, modal mineralogy of the solid residue,
 and major and trace element concentrations of the incremental melt fractions
 are tracked through the melting column.
 The range in compositions of primitive olivine phenocrysts crystallised
 at the shallow basalt liquidus are determined.
 The model assesses the partitioning behaviour of first row transition elements
 (FRTE) including Ni and Mn using data from recent studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Major and minor element analyses are carried out on olivine phenocrysts
 from five geographically dispersed Icelandic eruptions.
 Ranges of 1200pm and 1500ppm are found in the Ni and Mn concentrations
 respectively, with a large part of this variation correlating with olivine
 fractionation.
 At given Fo ranges of 800ppm and 300ppm are observed in Ni and Mn respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Model results are compared to measured compositions of Icelandic olivines
 and published olivine data from a range of geodynamic settings.
 It is found that almost all measured Ni and Mn are compatible with model
 predictions of fractional melting of pyrolitic peridotite.
 Ni and Mn signatures that have previously been attributed to pyroxenite
 melting are dominantly controlled by variation in mantle T

 and lithospheric thickness.
 The comparison indicates that a single source composition cannot account
 for all the variation in Ni and Mn.
 The variation in initial bulk Ni and Mn concentration of the peridotite
 required to match the data is in line with published estimates based on
 mantle xenoliths and abyssal peridotites.
 Preferential sampling of the high Ni and low Mn source in areas overlain
 by thick lithospere indicates that compositional variation is convolved
 with fusibility and hence mineralogy of the source.
 The variation in Ni and Mn concentrations between olivines from a single
 sample and from different Icelandic eruptions implies that lithological
 heterogeneity occurs on a short lengthscale within the mantle plume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
When source variability is permitted, data can be fit by any degree of melt
 mixing.
 The absence of highly forsteritic olivine (Fo>92) predicted for instantaneous
 fractional melts generated at shallow levels does however imply that some
 mixing of melts occurs.

Mantle heterogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle is an integral part of plate
 tectonics, with oceanic lithosphere being generated at mid-ocean ridges
 and recycled back into the mantle at subduction zones.
 This geodynamic cycle is important in generating mantle heterogeneity (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Stracke2003"

\end_inset

).
 Recycled oceanic lithosphere comprising enriched oceanic crust and the
 complementary highly depleted upper mantle (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "allegre1986"

\end_inset

) undergoes both mechanical mixing and chemical reaction within the principally
 peridotitic convecting mantle.

 Thus this diagram illustrates just one model of the possible processes.

\begin_layout Standard
Basalt geochemistry is the principle tool for sampling variation in mantle
 composition.
 Variations in radiogenic isotope ratios and trace element concentrations
 in mantle-derived basalts have long been used to demonstrate that Earth’s
 mantle is chemically heterogeneous (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Hofmann1982a,Zindler1986a,Stracke2005"

\end_inset

).
 The enriched recycled lithologies have been invoked as a source for ocean
 island basalts (OIBs); providing an explanation for the high incompatible
 trace element concentrations and enriched isotopic ratios of OIBs relative
 to mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Hofmann1982a"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recently it has been shown that isotopic variation correlates with
 major and minor element variability of erupted basalts (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Dasgupta2010,Hauri1996a"

\end_inset

) suggesting that isotopic end-members correspond to lithological or mineralogic
al heterogeneities in the mantle source regions.
 Constraining the nature of the major element heterogeneity is paramount
 as it is major element chemistry that controls the physical and chemical
 properties of the mantle which are important in the analysis of both geochemica
l and geophysical data.
 Constraints on the nature and quantification of the amount of recycled
 lithologies in the source region of OIBs would also provide insights into
 the distribution of recycled lithologies in the upper mantle and the processes
 that create, modify, and destroy heterogeneities in Earth’s interior.

Sampling major and minor element heterogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First-row transition elements (FRTE), including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
 Ni, Cu, and Zn, have emerged as potential indicators of basalt petrogenesis.
 They are present in minor abundance in the Earth's mantle, are compatible
 or only mildly incompatible during partial melting in Earth’s mantle and
 unlike incompatible trace elements are insensitive to the extent of melting
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Davis2013"

\end_inset

).
 The relative compatibilities of these elements in different mantle phases
 causes their ratios in erupted lavas to be controlled by the residual phases
 in equilibrium with the partial melts.
 Thus they are potential tracers of mineralogical heterogeneity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of high-profile recent publications have used the minor element
 contents of olivines contained in primitive basalts to infer the presence
 of large quantities of recycled basaltic material in their mantle source
 regions.
 It has been argued that the observed high Ni and low Ca and Mn concentrations
 cannot be generated by a peridotitic source, but rather that an olivine-free
 pyroxenite source component is required (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "sobolev2005,Sobolev2007,Herzberg2011"

\end_inset

).
 In their model Si-rich melts derived by deep (190-180km) melting of eclogitic
 recycled oceanic crust react with peridotite producing olivine-free pyroxenite
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "sobolev2005,Yaxley1998"

\end_inset

).
 At a given pressure and temperature melting of this hybrid olivine-free
 lithology is more voluminous than melting of peridotite meaning aggregate
 melts will be biased toward those derived from pyroxenite (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pertermann2003b"

\end_inset

).
 The lower compatibility of Ni and higher compatibility of Mn and Ca in
 pyroxene relative to olivine means pyroxenite-derived melts are characteristica
lly enriched in Si and Ni but depleted in Mg, Ca, and Mn compared with their
 peridotite-derived counterparts.

 A similar model has been proposed for melting beneath Iceland and other
 mantle plumes.
 Recycled material is concentrated in the plume centre.
 Recycled eclogite is highly fusible and starts to melt at great depth.
 This melt disappears at lower pressures because it separates from eclogite
 and is consumed by reaction with peridotite to produce secondary pyroxenite
 (

\begin_layout Standard
The assertion that a distinct olivine-free lithology is required has come
 under scrutiny with some researchers arguing that the olivine compositions
 can more simply be explained by partial melting of peridotites variably
 refertilized with MORB (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Shorttle2011a"

\end_inset

).
 Others highlight the importance of the conditions of melt generation over
 source mineralogy reasoning that, if variation in the partition coefficients
 as a function of pressure, temperature and melt composition are properly
 taken into consideration, the olivine compositions can be generated from
 partial melts of mineralogically homogeneous peridotite (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Matzen2013,Putirka2011"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fractional melting control on minor element partitioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Major and trace element chemistry of mantle melts are controlled by depth
 and extent of melting and source composition as well as crustal processes
 including low-pressure fractional crystallisation and crustal assimilation.
 As a result major and trace element signatures inherited from the mineralogy
 of the source are difficult to uniquely distinguish.
 To meaningfully constrain source mineralogy its affect must be considered
 in conjunction with all other processes and variables involved in the generatio
n and modification of melts prior to their eruption at the surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In light of this, an important problem with many previous studies of the
 behavior of FRTE in olivine is that they have included overly simplistic
 approximations of the mantle melting process and have not used the most
 up-to-date partitioning models.
 Generation of melt in the mantle is thought to be dominated by polybaric
 fractional melting (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Kelemen1997b"

\end_inset

), however many previous models are based on assumptions of isobaric, modal,
 batch melting.
 To make quantitative predictions of the amount of recycled material in
 the source region it is vital that the role of the melting process is properly
 addressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accurately modelling the fractional melting process is important as it allows
 us to constrain whether the observed minor element contents of olivines
 from basalts can be generated by fractional melting of a peridotite alone
 or whether the involvement of enriched recycled lithologies is required.

Sample Collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study the variability of minor element concentrations in olivine from
 primitive basalts it is desirable to focus on an area where compositional
 heterogeneity of the melt supply from the mantle has been demonstrated
 and, ideally, where previous estimates of the proportion of recycled material
 in the source has been estimated.
 Iceland represents the only subaerial section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
 Its easily accessible basaltic flows provide a unique record of mantle
 melting.
 Isotopic and trace element data from whole-rock samples indicate that the
 composition of mantle melts generated under the neovolcanic zones of Iceland
 is variable (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fieldwork was undertaken in Iceland between the dates of 14/07/2013 and
 30/08/2013.
 Approximately three weeks of this time were spent sampling primitive basalts
 and picrites aong the neovolcanic zones.
 A number of localities were visited in the Northern Volcanic zone, the
 Western Volcanic zone, and on Reykjanes penisula where hand specimens containin
g fresh olivine phenocrysts were collected.

Sample Selection and Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five eruptions, representative of the diversity of Icelandic melt compositions
 were selected for microanalysis.
 In order to maximise spread in the data between enriched and depleted endmember
s and to test the role of lithospheric thickness in controlling the distribution
 of melting within the mantle geographically dispersed eruptions were chosen.
 Along the axis of active spreading in the neovolcanic zones, active rift
 tectonics causes thinning of the lithosphere and allows mantle to upwell
 to shallow levels.
 The melts produced here have a large contribution from high melt fraction
 shallow melts and can thus be expected to be relatively depleted in incompatibl
e trace elements.
 In contrast off-axis melting, where the lithosphere is not thinned by active
 rifting, the minimum depth to which the mantle upwells is higher.
 Melt fractions are lower and the melts produced are enriched in incompatible
 trace elements.
 Choosing both on-axis and flank zone basalts also allows us to test the
 hypothesis of recycled pyroxenite existing within the melting region.
 At the same Tp pyroxenite melts at higher pressure than peridotite, eruptions
 overlying thicker parts of the lithosphere would thus be expected to have
 greater proportional contribution from pyroxenite melting as shallow melting
 of peridotite is suppressed.

Sample Preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Samples were prepared for chemical analysis by first crushing the rocks.
 Handpicked olivine phenocrysts and glass chips were then mounted in epoxy
 and polished to expose the crystals and achieve a smooth surfce.
 Phenocrysts from Midfell, Stapafell and Kistufell were picked from the
 glassy pillow rim samples, whereas those for Blafjall were picked from
 the pillow interior due to the scarcity of olivines in glassy samples.

15 vol%.
 It also contains fairly abundant plagioclase phenocrysts, some of which
 were megacrysts such as that seen in the top left of the image.
 Rarer green clinopyroxene was also present suggesting that this basalt
 started to crystallise deep within the crust.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olivine phenocrysts were analyzed using the Cameca SX100 electron microprobe
 at the University of Cambridge.
 Five days were spent on the microprobe.
 Samples were analysed using an accelerating voltage of 15 keV and a beam
 size of 1µm.
 For the first two days on the microprobe a single condition was used with
 all elements (Si, Ti, Mg, Fe, Mn, Ni, Ca, Al, Cr) measured at a high current
 of 60nA and counting times of 20s (Si, Fe, Mg), 40s (Ti, Cr) and 120s (Al,
 Mn, Ca, Ni).
 Data from this session yielded unexpectedly low totals of between 97-98wt%
 outside the acceptable range of 100±1%.
 These low totals were a result of the high current causing saturation of
 the detector for major elements.
 Thus the deficit in the totals was made up uniformly of the major elements
 (SiO2, MgO, FeO).
 Despite minor and trace element data probably being of unaffected, the
 data measured during this setup was discarded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the following three days two conditions were used with a beam current
 of 20nA (Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Mg) or 60nA (Al, Mn, Ca, Ni, ±P).
 Counting times of 20s (Si, Fe, Mg), 40s (Ti, Cr, P) or 120s (Al, Mn, Ca,
 Ni) were used.
 This setup yielded totals between 99-101% with most values lying in the
 range 99.5-100.5%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measurements were calibrated using the St Johns olivine standard.
 Olivine core compositions were analysed to avoid any diffusional overprint
 and three point measurements were taken per olivine to check their homogeneity
 and reduce analytical errors.
 The composition of each olivine was found by averaging the three measurements.
 In total 
\begin_inset Formula $~$
\end_inset

42 olivine phenocrysts were analyzed per flow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closely spaced linear profiles across several olivines were also measured,
 with at least one profile taken for each sample with the exception of Blafjall
 for which lack of glassy rims made it impossible to determine the edge
 of the crystal.
 These profiles allow the determination of presence and shape of mineral
 zonation and diffusional rim overprints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average errors (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{av}=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}\sigma_{i}}{\sqrt{n}},$
\end_inset

 n=3) from the counting statistics for each species are given in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:errors"

\end_inset

.
 Accuracy of the measurements is determined by comparison of the measured
 composition of the mineral standard with the accepted values.
 The minor elements of interest in this study (Mn, Ca, Ni) all have percentage
 errors less than 10%.
 The trace elements Ti, Cr and P have very high errors >100%, however their
 concentration is of little interest here and will not be included in further
 discussion.

\begin_layout Standard
Ni and Mn strongly correlate with Fo.
 Since Ni is compatible in olivine progressive olivine fractionation causes
 the residual Ni concentration to decrease.
 Conversely, Mn is incompatible in olivine meaning Mn concentration increases
 with olivine fractionation.
 To constrain mantle source composition the effects of fractionation must
 be removed.
 Therefore in addition to Mn and Ni concentrations Mn/Fe and Ni/(Mg/Fe)
 ratios are also plotted.
 These ratios do not vary significantly with olivine fractionation.
 There is still some fractionation dependence, making it hard to make inferences
 about the primitive mantle melts for Hreggnasi due its high extents of
 fractionation.

Ca is the parameter least dependent on olivine fractionation.
 Thus, it is diagnostic of parental magma compositional differences.
 More variation is seen in Ca between the different flows than in Mn/Fe
 or Ni/(Mg/Fe) ratios.
 Midfell is the most enriched in Ca while Hreggnasi and Stapafell are depleted
 in Ca and Kistufell and Blafjall have intermediate concentrations.
 Midfell has unusually high Ca concentrations, projecting above most MORB
 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ca concentrations agree with expectations.
 Hreggnasi and Stapafell occur in the flank zones where the lithosphere
 is thick due to the absence of active extensional tectonics.
 The geodynamic setting is thus more similar to that of the WPM-thick group.
 Midfell, Kistufell and Blafjall occur within the neo-volcanic zones where
 the lithosphere is thinned by active rifting.
 The greater contribution from shallow melting means they have greater affinity
 to MORB.

These trends in magma composition are produced by a combination of source
 and melting process effects.
 Without clues from isotope data it is difficult to deconvolve these two
 effects.
 The potential roles of source mineralogy and the fractional melting process
 will be discussed later.
 Additional to mantle source effects and fractional crystallisation some
 of the variablity observed may be due to shallow processes such as assimilation
 of crustal melts or localized reaction with cumulate rocks.
 There is some indication of mixing in the Blafjall sample with primitive
 mantle melts mixing with a more evolved low Ca end-member; potentially
 representing crustal melts or contamination by hydrothermal alteration,
 although no signs of alteration were observed in hand specimen.

\noindent
Rim gradients, which are identified from scanning electron microscope (SEM)
 images and measured by taking closely-spaced profiles, were found to be
 negligible in olivines from Midfell and Kistufell indicating either minimal
 magma mixing during their generation, or a long period of incubation for
 diffusional re-equilibration of the rims.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stronger gradients are observed in olivines from Stapafell and Hreggnasi.
 Some Stapafell olivines show narrow normal zonation (Figures

LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:stap7-profile"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:stap18-profile"

\end_inset

).
 The smooth variation in concentration of the different species (Mg-Fe,
 Ni, Ca, Mn) suggests they are produced as diffusional overprints from re-equili
bration with a more evolved disequilibrium carrier liquid rather than forming
 by crystallisation upon cooling.
 The irregular resorptional margins of some of the olivines (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:stap7-profile"

\end_inset

(A))provides further evidence that these olivines were out of equilibrium.
 The re-equilibration has been interpretted to occur after re-entrainment
 from a cumulate (

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hreggnasi olivines show a variety of rim gradients including normal, reverse
 and oscillatory zonation; consistent with a complex history of magma mixing/
 assimilation.
 The changes in concentration are often sharp and represent overgrowths
 following a change in carrier melt composition.
 Diffusional overprinting is also evident.
 Examples showing the variety of rim gradients are shown in Figures

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, even in the most strongly zoned crystals, compositional gradients
 are restricted to the crystal rims (which are typically <100µm).
 The olivines have homogeneous interiors which are unaffected by diffusion
 and can thus be assumed to record the composition of the magmas from which
 they were initially crystallised.
 This could be verified by measuring the composition of melt inclusions
 to check they are in equilibrium with the olivine.

 The Mn and Ni record the later overgrowth of more primitive olivine within
 the outer 20µm, while Ca does not.
 This is indicative of diffusive re-equilibration as the diffusivity of
 Ca in olivine is greater than Mg-Fe, Mn and Ni.
 The 2-stage zonation suggests a more complex history involving at least
 two phases of compositional change of the host liquid.

 A correlating increase in Ni and decrease in Mn are obserevd in the outer

 Ca shows a smooth increase due to the faster rates of diffusive re-equilibratio

 The more forsteritic outer rim suggests either that this is an antecryst,
 grown in a more evolved melt, that was entrained in a more primitive melt
 during a magma-mixing event; or that the fractionated host melt was replenished
 with more primitive melt from a deeper reservoir.

 mantle melting.
 The benefits of this treatment are that it is computationally efficient
 and mathematically simple.
 This means that the effect of different parameters can easily be discerned
 and initial conditions varied over wide ranges applicable to mantle melting
 on Earth whilst stability of the model is maintained.
 An additional benefit is that the most up-to-date experimental partitioning
 data can be used.

\begin_layout Standard
The anhydrous peridotite solidus and liquidus are parameterised as second-order
 polynomials fit to experimental data.
 As well as the ‘true liquidus’ a ‘lherzolite liquidus’ is also introduced
 as a means for creating a kinked melting function at cpx-out.
 It can be conceptualised as the temperature the liquidus would have if
 cpx remained in the residue (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Katz2003"

\end_inset

).
 Prior to exhaustion of cpx F is expressed as a power-law of the fractional
 distance in temperature between the solidus and the lherzolite liquidus
 (equation 5.1), while after exhaustion of cpx, it is a function of the fractiona
l distance between

 and the true liquidus (equation 5.2).

The kinking of the melting function at cpx-out reflects the discontinuous

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The presence of small amounts of volatiles would act to increase the depth
 of the solidus and liquidii permitting melting to occur at greater depth.
 However due to the incompatiblity of water during melting, the residue
 is quickly stripped of all its water causing melting to proceed anhydrously
 after only a very small degree of melting; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the mid-ocean ridge setting, such as at Iceland, the mantle upwells to
 shallow depths and large degrees of melting are attained.
 Thus the small degree of hydrous melting is volumetrically negligible.
 It follows that in intraplate setting where melting is restricted to occuring
 at great depths, the role of hydrous melting becomes more important and
 the assumption of anhydrous melting less valid.

Modal mineralogy of residue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To generate the residual modal mineralogy with depth, an initial mineralogy
 of the unmelted peridotite must be input into the model.
 This is then passed through the subsolidus and melting reactions to calculate
 the mineralogy of the solid residue.
 The chosen mineralogy must be consistent with general expectations of the
 composition of the upper mantle and be representative of the compositions
 used in the peridotite melting studies used to constrain parameters included
 later in the model.
 The upper mantle (DMM) is thought to have a pyrolitic composition corresponding
 to a fertile lherzolite (e.g.

).
 The mineralogy reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is used as a median estimate of ‘typical’ DMM.
 Variable depletion by partial melting to produce basaltic melts or variable
 enrichment by metasomatism means the mineralogy of the mantle may vary
 on a range of lengthscales.
 To account for this, a range of initial mineralogies are considered ranging
 from a fertile lherzolite, typified by KR4003 (

Melting reaction coefficients are obtained from various experimental studies.
 Reactions change once minerals such as cpx or the aluminous phase are exhausted
 from the residue.
 The reaction coefficients used are given in Table

\end_inset

.
 During lherzolite melting cpx is the main phase contributing to the melt
 while after cpx has been exhausted opx is the main melting phase.
 The dramatic switch in melting reaction at cpx-out is responsible for the
 discontinuous decrease in isobaric productivity at this point.

Melt Composition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Melting occurs beneath mid-ocean ridges within a 2-dimensional melting region
 and melts erupted at the surface are a complex weighted average of the
 melt produced at depth.
 The melting path described above is for a 1-dimensional column of upwelling
 mantle.
 Within this column two different melt compositions can be defined.
 The instantaneous melt composition c(F,P) is that of melts generated over
 each increment of pressure, P to P+dP, and melt fraction, F to F+dF.
 After weighting these incremental melts by dF they can be summed to yield
 an average composition generated along the melting path (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Mckenzie1988"

\end_inset

).
 This composition is refered to as the point average melt composition C(F,P)
 and is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C(F)=\frac{1}{F}\int_{0}^{F}c(F')dF'
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the instantaneous melt composition is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c=\frac{d}{dF}(FC)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The average composition of all the melt generated is termed the point and
 depth average ζ and depends on the weighted average of c over the whole
 melting region.
 The weighting of melts generated in the melting region is a function of
 both F and the mantle flow field.
 The mantle flow field is different in the cases of passive upwelling at
 mid-ocean ridges and dynamic upwelling of a mantle plume.
 In general the average melt composition is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{\int_{v}c\left(\frac{dF}{dt}\right)dV}{\int_{v}\left(\frac{dF}{dt}\right)dV}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where V is the melting volume and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dF}{dt}$

 They showed that for the special case of an isoviscous mantle, solutions
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$

 for corner flow are equivalent to those for mantle upwelling with constant
 velocity, w, in the melting region.
 Taking the expression for F(P,T,
\begin_inset Formula $X_{cpx}$
\end_inset

) from above, if isotherms are horizontal and mantle entering the melting
 region is homogeneous then F varies only as a function of depth.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dF}{dt}$
\end_inset

 is then given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dz}{dt}\frac{dF}{dz}=w\frac{dF}{dz}$

This model of average melt composition is not applicable to active upwelling

 Iceland represents the surface expression of a mantle plume that is spatially

 mantle flow velocity to be constant throughout the melting region.

An important question to consider is which of these compositions is represented
 by the melts erupted at the surface.
 If mixing and homogenisation of melts within the melting region were complete
 you would expect to sample the point and depth average composition.
 The range in isotope and trace element ratios observed at a single locality
 suggest that mixing is not complete.
 The other extremity is that there is no mixing within the melt column.
 In this case a wide range of melt compositions would be sampled representing
 the instantaneous fractional melt compositions generated at different depths
 within the melting column.
 This too is unrealistic as mixing is suggested by the fact that trace element
 and isotopic compositions of melt inclusions are known to be far more variable
 than those of their carrier magmas (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Maclennan2008c"

\end_inset

).
 This implies that there must be some degree of mixing and homogenisation
 of melts either during their ascent to the surface or when pooled in a
 crustal magma chamber.
 Although numerous geochemical studies qualitatively highlight the role
 of magma mixing, the exact extent of mixing is poorly constrained.
 It is therefore important to consider the maximum possible range in composition
s that can be acheived by fractional melting i.e.
 by considering the instantaneous fractional melt compositions.
 Throughout the model all three melt compositions are calculated.

Major element melt composition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partitioning of many FRTE is dependent on the MgO and FeO content of
 the melt (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Beattie1991,Herzberg2002,Matzen2013"

\end_inset

).
 To accurately model the distributions of FRTE during mantle melting it
 is therefore necesary to model the major element melt composition.
 Unlike minor and trace elements which behave in a Henrian manor and can
 be described statistically using partition coefficients, major elements
 are the main constituents of minerals and their absolute concentrations
 control the phases present.
 Modelling their concentrations in the melt requires a full thermodynamic
 treatment.
 A simpler method is to construct a parameterisation based on experimental
 melting studies.
 The parameterisation of melt composition as a function of melt fraction
 and pressure of

The principle aim of this study is to model the Ni and Mn concentrations
 of olivines crystallized from primitive melts.
 A number of other FRTE minor elements were also included in the model.

The way in which trace elements partition between the solid and melt phase
 is described quantitatively by partition coefficients.
 A growing body of experimental work has gone into the determination of
 partition coefficients of trace elements under a range of conditions applicable
 to melting within the earth.
 Partition coefficients are in general found to be a function of temperature
 and melt composition with negligible pressure dependence.
 A common way of parameterising 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}^{j/L}$
\end_inset

 is to combine the temperature and melt composition dependence by expressing
 it in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Mg}^{j/L}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Mg}^{j/L}$
\end_inset

 is a function of the Mg and Fe content of the melt and mineral which in
 turn vary with F.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Mg}^{ol/L}$

and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Mg}^{ol/L}$

The composition and temeprature dependence of the partition coeffcients
 was only considered for olivine and orthopyroxene, which together account
 for 80-95 wt% of mantle peridotite.
 For the remaining phases constant partition coefficients were used.

\begin_layout Standard
Before calculating the trace element content of the melt the initial trace
 element concentration of the source is set.
 The major and trace element concentrations of upper mantle peridotite are
 constrained from mantle xenoliths carried in ultramafic magmas and from
 bulk Earth partitioning models.
 Due to variable enrichment and depletion of the mantle by partial melting
 and metasomatism, concentrations vary.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 determined that bulk NiO of the depleted peridotite varies between 2500-3500ppm
, corresponding to a bulk Ni of 
\begin_inset Formula $~$
\end_inset

1500-2500ppm.
 No such detailed study for the distribution of bulk MnO concentration is
 available.
 A range of 1100-1300ppm is used as this range covers the values reported
 in the literature (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Workman2005,Davis2009a"

\end_inset

).
 This is actually a conservative estimate of the range.
 Lower values down to 800ppm are recorded for more depleted peridotites
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Salters2004"

\end_inset

).
 The effect of varying source concentration on the final olivine composition
 is discussed in section 6.1.
 Estimates of the concentrations of all FRTE included in the model (excluding
 Fe and Ca which are included in the major element parameterisation) are
 given in Table

These compositions represent the most primitive olivine phenocrysts to crystalli
se from the melts.
 Even when only highly magnesian basalts are sampled, a certain amount of
 crystal fractionation will have occurred.
 Olivine is the first phase to arrive on the liquidus followed by plagioclase
 and cpx.
 In all of the Icelandic samples olivine is the predominant phenocryst phase,
 however plagioclase phenocrysts also occur in smaller quantities in all
 but the Blafjall sample.
 It is assumed that fractionation of plagioclase has only a small affect
 on the melt composition and the crystal line of descent is modelled for
 olivine fractionation only.

Partition coefficients are controlled by modal mineralogy of the solid residue
 and the melting conditions, including temperature and major element melt
 composition.
 The effect of changing mineralogy is most clearly seen at the garnet-spinel
 and spinel-plagioclase transitions.
 For trace elements including Sc and Cr the change in partition coefficient
 across the transitions is quite dramatic.
 A sharp peak in most partition coefficients coincides with the exhaustion
 of cpx from the residue.
 Rather than being due to a change in minerals contributing to the melt,
 this peak corresponds to minimums in 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{Mg}^{L}$

and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{Fe}^{L}$

Although only

), the partition coefficients of other FRTE including Mn vary significantly
 with mantle 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 This is due both to the difference in residual mineralogy during melting
 (fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 At elevated

 Mn behaves incompatibly, but at lower 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}$

 it becomes compatible for very shallow melting.
 The explicit temperature dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Ni}$
\end_inset

 casues Ni to become more compatible with decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}$

 and for melting at shallower levels in the melting column.
 However following the exhaution of cpx, melt compositional effects dominate
 and causing

 to decrease.
 The compatibility of Ni and Mn change in opposite senses across the gt-sp
 transition:Ni is more compatible in the sp-field, while Mn is more compatible

Depth of olivine crystallisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most partition coefficients, including 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Mn}^{ol/L}$
\end_inset

, have no explicit T-dependence.
 This means that provided the melt composition remains constant the concentratio
n of olivine crystallised from the melt is independent of depth of crystallisati
on.
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Ni}^{ol/L}$
\end_inset

 is temperature-dependent.
 Compatibility of Ni in olivine increases with decreasing temperature meaning
 olivine crystallised at shallower levels within the crust will be more
 enriched in Ni.
 Melts are stalled in the crust at a range of depths (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "White2011"

\end_inset

) and olivine crystallised in mush-layers of deep chambers can be remobilised
 and erupted at the surface.
 For the Icelandic melting scenario varying the depth of crystallisation
 from 20km (lower crust intrusion) to 2km (shallow intrusion) causes Ni
 to increase by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

300ppm (fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:change-Px"

\end_inset

).
 For a polyphase crystallisation history in which olivine is crystallised
 at a range of depths, this effect may account for some of the variability
 observed in olivines from a single flow.

\begin_layout Standard
The composition of the mantle beneath Iceland is inferred to vary on a short
 lengthscale (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Shorttle2011a"

\end_inset

).
 The consequence of this is that the initial trace element concentration
 cannot be assumed to be single-valued as magma erupted at the surface may
 sample a range of mantle compositions.
 This source variability may be largely responsible for the distribution
 of olivine Ni and Mn concentrations observed in a single eruption.
 Source heterogeneity is exaggerated in the final olivine composition.
 For example a range of 1000ppm between minimum and maximum initial Ni leads
 to a range of 1800ppm in the olivine concentration.

Source mineralogy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mantle peridotite in the source region may be variably enriched or depleted.
 To explore the effect of fertility model results for the three peridotite
 modal mineralogies from section 5.2 are compared.
 Increasing fertility increases the modal cpx and decreases the relative
 abundance of olivine.
 This causes a slight increase in Ni concentration of the melt and of olivine
 crystallised from the melt due to the lower compatibility of Ni in cpx
 relative to olivine.
 Increased fertility has minor effect on Mn.
 The olivine Ni concentration from melting of a refractory harzburgite is
 lower for given Fo than for pyrolite due to the increased modal olivine.
 Mn concentration does not change in a predictable manor and is dependent
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 Cpx is exhausted from the residue very quickly causing productivity to
 be lower than when melting pyrolite.
 The effect of this is that lower melting degree and lower Fo are attained.
 The range in Ni and Mn concentrations are also significantly reduced.

Comparison of model to olivine data: Can fractional melting do it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model shows that a wide range of melt compositions can be acheived during
 fractional melting of peridotite.
 The fundamental question this project aims to address is whether fractional
 melting of peridotite alone is sufficient to explain observed olivine minor
 element concentrations.
 This question is explored by comparison of synthetic results with measured
 olivine concentrations from Iceland and other geodynamic settings.

On Iceland seismic and gravity studies constrain crustal thickness on Iceland

 The mantle

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Melting is therefore modelled using

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{l}$

 ‘Normal’ pyrolitic mantle mineralogy is used, and olivine is made to crystallis
e at 6km depth.
 To match the Fo of the Icelandic data 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{d_{Fe^{2+}-Mg}}^{ol/L}=0.28$
\end_inset

 is used.
 The fit of the model to the Icelandic data is first considered for Iceland
 as a whole, before focussing on how the differences between individual
 eruptions can be explained.

\begin_layout Standard
The ranges in model Ni and Mn concentrations of olivines crystallised from
 instantateous fractional melts are significant, particularly for Ni.
 When extrapolated back to Fo=90-92 all Ni concentrations (excluding one
 anomalously forsteritic olivine from Midfell) can be fit by instantaneous
 fractional melts of a peridotite with initial bulk Ni of 1750ppm.
 For this to be the case all melt fractions, including the endmember melts
 generated at the very base and very top of the melting column, would have
 to ascend to the surface and erupt through the crust without any mixing
 or homogenisation occurring.
 For reasons discussed in section 5.3 this is unlikely to be true.
 If however the Ni concentration of the initial mantle source is allowed
 to range between 1500 and 2000ppm the data can be fit by the aggregated
 melts.
 This applies to both point average composition, which is used here to represent
 the case of partial homogenisation, and point and depth average composition,
 which would apply to the case of complete mixing of melts throughout the
 melting region.
 This interpretation requires the concentration of Ni in the mantle beneath
 Iceland to be at the lower end of the global distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When coupled with models of Mn concentration the case for some degree of
 source heterogeneity is stronger.
 The range in Mn concentration from instantaneous fractional melts is not
 as large as for Ni and a single source composition is not sufficient to
 fit the data.
 Rather initial bulk Mn concentration is required to vary between 1100 and
 1300ppm, i.e.
 cover almost the full range in estimated peridotite concentrations.
 As for Ni, Mn concentrations can be fit by any degree of melt mixing.

The requirement of a range of initial Ni and Mn source concentrations implies
 that the mantle beneath Iceland is heterogeneous on a small-scale.
 The small-scale varaiability can be mapped at higher resolution by looking
 at the composition of individual eruptions from different areas of Iceland.

\begin_layout Subsection
Constraints on mantle source heterogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost all the olivine compositions measured from both the new Icelandic
 data and published data are consistent with fractional melting of pyrolitic
 peridotite followed by fractionation of olivine in a crustal magma chamber.
 Some compositional heterogeneity is required, but this variation is well
 within the range observed in peridotitic mantle xenoliths and abyssal peridotit
es.
 Such variability can be envisioned to be caused by variable depletion by
 partial melting to produce basaltic melts or by metasommatic enrichment
 by addition of recycled MORB.
 Importantly an olivine-free source lithology as hypothesised by a number
 of researchers (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Herzberg2013,sobolev2005,Sobolev2007"

\end_inset

) is not required.
 The differences in the distributions of Ni and Mn concentrations seen in
 different geodynamic settings are principally controlled by the combined
 effects of variable T
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
p
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and t
\begin_inset script subscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout
l
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The higher upper bound of bulk Ni in the source required to fit data from
 the WPM-thick group suggests that compositional variation is convolved
 with fusibility of the source.
 Rather than being due to elevated bulk Ni and Mn in this source material
 this is more likely to be a result of mineralogical variability as hypothesised
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Shorttle2011a"

\end_inset

.
 Further modelling using sources variably enriched in basaltic melts is
 required to show this, however to do this the reduction in solidus temperature
 for these more fusible sources needs to be taken into consideration.
 To get a more complete story one needs to look at isotopes.
 Many studies have shown correlation between istopes incompatible trace
 elements and major elements (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Fitton2003,Shorttle2011a"

\end_inset

) suggesting heterogeneities do exist as mineralogically distinct regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown from the variation within single eruption and between different
 eruptions on Iceland, mantle heterogeneity must occur on a small-scale
 with the Icelandic mantle plume.

Conclusions

FRTE partition coefficients are found to be strongly dependent on the major
 element melt composition which in turn is controlled by mantle T

 The accute melt composition control often overwhelms explicit temperature
 dependence.

 tends to increase causing the Mn content of crystallised olivine to decrease
 and Ni content to increase.

, and correspondingly in olivine Mn and Ni concentration, occur at the point
 when clinopyroxene is exhausted from the residue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the Icelandic samples ranges of 1200pm and 1500ppm are found in the
 Ni and Mn concentrations respectively, with a large part of this variation
 correlating with olivine fractionation.
 At given Fo ranges of 800ppm and 300ppm are observed in Ni and Mn respectively.
 Of the three most primitive samples studied, Blafjall has the highest Ni
 and lowest Mn content while Midfell has the greatest affinity to MORB,
 with lower Ni and higher Mn.
 These differences are most likely to reflect differences in source composition.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For Ni and Mn, the range in minor element concentrations of primitive olivines
 can be generated solely by the fractional melting of peridotitic mantle.
 An olivine-free source lithology is not required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The comparison indicates that a single source composition cannot account
 for all the variation in Ni and Mn.
 The variation in initial bulk Ni and Mn concentration of the peridotite
 required to match the data is in line with published estimates based on
 mantle xenoliths and abyssal peridotites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When source variability is permitted, data can be fit by any degree of melt
 mixing.
 The absence of highly forsteritic olivine (Fo>92) predicted for instantaneous
 fractional melts generated at shallow levels does however imply that some
 mixing of melts occurs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The variation in Ni and Mn concentrations between olivines from a single
 sample and from different eruptions implies that lithological heterogeneity
 occurs on a short lengthscale within the mantle plume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Preferential sampling of the high Ni and low Mn source in areas overlain
 by thick lithospere indicates that compositional variation is convolved
 with fusibility and hence mineralogy of the source.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This work highlights the the important role of fractional melting in minor
 element partitioning and draws into question the validity of quantitative
 estimates of the amount of recycled material in the mantle source region
 based on simplified melting models.
 Further work is required to develop a bilithologic melting model for a
 peridotite-pyroxenite mantle source to evaluate more directly the potential
 contribution of olivine-free lithologies in the source region.
 If it is found that ranges in Ni and Mn contents of olivine crystallised
 from fractional melts of peridotite and pyroxenite overlap considerably
 it would be impossible to denconvolve the relative contributions from the
 different lithologies.
 There would be a tradeoff between extent of mixing of instantaneous fractional
 melts from different levels in the melting region and the contribution
 from melting of recycled lithologies.

Self-Assesment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I choose this project because it offerred the prospect of developing a broad
 skill-set- involving both labwork and computing and the opportunity to
 do fieldwork in Iceland.
 The project also stood out as it had a clear objective which had potentially
 important repurcussions on a topical area of research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fieldwork in Iceland over the summer was really enjoyable.
 John and Oli Shorttle were brilliant company in the field and gave alot
 of guidance.
 I feel that visiting the field area and collecting my own samples gave
 me a deeper understanding of Icelandic geology and also enhanced my enthusiam
 for the project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided to prepare my own samples for microprobe analysis.
 This was very time-consuming and took up over two weeks.
 Despite this I felt it was useful to learn the techniques, and I could
 now prepare the samples alot more efficiently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The incorrect set-up used for the first two days on the probe meant that
 all data measured in the these sessions were discarded losing me a full
 week of work.
 Thankfully I managed to get an extra day on the probe meaning that although
 some time was wasted, all the high-quality data required for the rest of
 the project was obtained in the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having no previous experience coding or using matlab, the learning curve
 for the model-development was steep.
 Throwing myself in at the deep end meant that I learnt the necessary skills
 very fast, however it also meant that the model was built on shaky foundations.
 I found myself continually back-tracking and restructuring the code as
 the model became more complex.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial aim was to develop a bi-lithlogic melting model to directly
 explore the involvement of lithologic heterogeneities in mantle melting.
 Due to the time-constraints I decided to limit the model to melting of
 a single lithology.
 This was also in part a pragmatic decision.
 The partitioning data available in the literature for pyroxenite melting
 is sparse and it would have been almost impossible to parameterise the
 major element melt composition without relying on a thermodynamic model
 such as MELTs.
 The model would therefore have been unreliable at best.
 Focussing on peridotite melting, for which there is a large body of relevant
 literature, meant I could explore the effects of different variables on
 the melting systematics more thoroughly.
 The outcome of this is a model which I am confident gives physically meaningful
 results.
 Despite this I plan to continue developing a bi-lithologic model in the
 future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The large untaking of building the melting model from scratch meant that
 I did not have time to delve into the relevant literature to the extent
 I would have liked.
 The majority of the reading I did was focussed on getting up-to-date model
 parameters, rather than on the general arguments surrounding major and
 trace element heterogeneity of the mantle.
 Not having time to form a more well-rounded view on this topic is one of
 my regrets of the project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarise, working on this project has been a very positive experience.
 John has been a great supervisor- very enthusiastic and always prepared
 to give advice.
 The project was perhaps overly ambitious, but I feel I have done justice
 to its core aims.
 Over and above the scientific results, I think the most valuable aspect
 of this project is the varied skillset that I have gained.
 Many of these skills, in particular those gained from the computing and
 lab-based work will be very useful for future research.

\begin_layout Description
Topic: Minor element variations in Icelandic olivines: Source or process
 controlled? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Supervisor: John Maclennan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Aims A number of high-profile recent publications have used the minor element
 contents of olivines contained in primitive basalts to infer the presence
 of large quantities of recycled basaltic material in their mantle source
 regions.
 Surprisingly, in locations such as Hawaii and the Siberian Traps, a growing
 number of researchers are taking the view that the dominant sources for
 the magmatism are olivine-poor pyroxenites rather than peridotites.
 This view is driven by an interpretation of measurements of the Ni and
 Mn contents of olivines that is founded upon a number of assumptions regarding
 the partitioning behaviour of such minor elements during mantle melting.
 The aim of the project is to assess the diversity of minor element contents
 of olivines in Icelandic samples and then to evaluate whether this variation
 can be accounted for by changes in the physical conditions of mantle melting
 alone, or if the spread in the olivines composition requires mineralogical
 heterogeneity in the mantle source regions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Methods A large dataset of Icelandic olivine compositions has previously
 been compiled and it is hoped that, by sampling and subsequent micro-analysis,
 the student will be able to add a significant amount of high-quality data
 to this compilation.
 The student will build models in order to link variation in the physical
 conditions of melting, mantle mineralogy, and olivine crystallisation to
 observed olivine compositions.
 They will use the results of a number of new partitioning studies in order
 to build these models.
 By comparison of the model results with the observations, it is hoped that
 they will be able to distinguish the effects of source heterogeneity and
 melting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Logistics If the student wishes to undertake fieldwork in Iceland, that
 will take place in the summer of 2013, at localities decided in discussion
 with the supervisor.
 Sample preparation and electron probe microanalysis will take place in
 the Department, with guidance from technical experts.
 The development of the models will require the student to learn to code
 in a suitable language, probably MATLAB, and the supervisor will assist
 with those choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Finance Funding for fieldwork may be partly obtained by the student.
 Support for related summer work in the Harker Collection may also be available.
 Funds are available to support the sample preparation and micro-analysis.
 Database manipulation and model development have no costs.

\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Electron microprobe data for Midfell olivines reported as wt% oxides.
 FeO* assumes all Fe present as FeO.
 Fo=100MgO/(MgO+FeO*) on a molar basis.
 These are average concentrations of three point measurements taken for
 each olivine.
 Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each oxide value are one sample standard
 deviation in terms of the least units cited, e.g.

\size large
 
\size default
40.6(4) represents 40.6±0.4.
 Dashes indicate that the element was not analysed or was below the detection
 limit of the microprobe.

\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Electron microprobe data for Stapafell olivines reported as wt% oxides.
 FeO* assumes all Fe present as FeO.
 Fo=100MgO/(MgO+FeO*) on a molar basis.
 These are average concentrations of three point measurements taken for
 each olivine.
 Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each oxide value are one sample standard
 deviation in terms of the least units cited, e.g.

\size large
 
\size default
40.6(4) represents 40.6±0.4.
 Dashes indicate that the element was not analysed or was below the detection
 limit of the microprobe.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Electron microprobe data for Kistufell olivines reported as wt% oxides.
 FeO* assumes all Fe present as FeO.
 Fo=100MgO/(MgO+FeO*) on a molar basis.
 These are average concentrations of three point measurements taken for
 each olivine.
 Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each oxide value are one sample standard
 deviation in terms of the least units cited, e.g.

\size large
 
\size default
40.6(4) represents 40.6±0.4.
 Dashes indicate that the element was not analysed or was below the detection
 limit of the microprobe.

\begin_inset Caption

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Electron microprobe data for Blafjall olivines reported as wt% oxides.
 FeO* assumes all Fe present as FeO.
 Fo=100MgO/(MgO+FeO*) on a molar basis.
 These are average concentrations of three point measurements taken for
 each olivine.
 Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each oxide value are one sample standard
 deviation in terms of the least units cited, e.g.

\size large
 
\size default
40.6(4) represents 40.6±0.4.
 Dashes indicate that the element was not analysed or was below the detection
 limit of the microprobe.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Electron microprobe data for Hreggnasi olivines reported as wt% oxides.
 FeO* assumes all Fe present as FeO.
 Fo=100MgO/(MgO+FeO*) on a molar basis.
 These are average concentrations of three point measurements taken for
 each olivine.
 Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each oxide value are one sample standard
 deviation in terms of the least units cited, e.g.

\size large
 
\size default
40.6(4) represents 40.6±0.4.
 Dashes indicate that the element was not analysed or was below the detection
 limit of the microprobe.
