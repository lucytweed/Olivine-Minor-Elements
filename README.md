# Olivine-Minor-Elements
Cambridge University Part III project. Investigating if minor element concentrations (Principally looking at Ni and Mn) of olivines in primitive Icelandic basalts can be used to constrain source mantle lithology. 

Project involves data collection for 4 different eruptions on Iceland. Samples collected in Iceland during Summer 2013. Major and minor element compositions measured by elctron probe in Cambridge.

Along side data analysis results are modelled using an empirical forward melting and crystallisation model. Model is a bilithologic model of a mixed peridotite-pyroxenite mantle. produced on Matlab.
